== Lab Environment
This lab utilizes Red Hat Product Demo System (RHPDS) to provision the lab environment.
RHPDS  uses Red Hat CloudForms to deploy infrastructure needed for our lab. +

The infrastructure consists of 5 VMs as well as the overall network configuration. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 has already been deployed for this lab.

OpenShift environment for this lab consists of the following systems:
